=== CONVERSATION HISTORY WITH FAITH_BUILDER ===
Generated: 2025-05-14 01:36
Total Memories: 433

=== KEY CONTEXT ===
We built a memory persistence system called ClaudUpgrade together.
Components created:
- SQLite database for persistent memory storage  
- FastAPI bridge to connect conversations to the database
- Browser extension to automatically capture Claude conversations
- Memory system with relationship tracking and importance ratings
